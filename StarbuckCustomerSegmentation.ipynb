What are better approaches to sending customer offers?  \nII.

Three files are povided, containing data on the three subjects:    \n- portfolio.csv - data about offers sent to customers (10 offers x 6 columns)  \n\n- profile.csv - demographic data of customers (17,000 customers x 5 columns)  \n    \n- transcript.csv - customer response to offers and transactions made (306,648 events x 4 columns)  \n    \n### Understand the Data and Situation\n#### Offers and customers\nDuring the month of campaign, offers of different types, duration, reward and difficulty were sent to customers through different channels (social media, email, mobile app and websites). There are 17,000 customers in the dataset whose age, gender, income and date of becoming a memebr are provided. During the month of campaign, offers were sent to customers through a combination of promitional channels every few days. Not all customers have received the same number of offers. Most customers received between 3 to 5 during the month, and some even received none.\n#### Events\nCustomer response to these offers and transactions made during the month are provided, and are recorded as _events_. There are three offer-related types of events, i.e. offer received, offer viewed and offer completed, and one other type of event called transaction, i.e. purchases made by a customer. Time when each event occurred is also provided, in the form of hours since the start of the campaign (the first offer was sent when time = 0 hour). ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2><center>Methodology</center></h2>\n\n### 1. Data Wrangling\nData was read into three Pandas DataFrames. In data wrangling, each DataFrame was cleaned and transformed to get ready for analysis.  \n\n### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nI first conducted EDA on the three DataFrames individually to obtain a thorough understanding of the data. Univariate analysis was conducted on all DataFrames, providing a summary on the statistics of all variables of each subject (offers, customers and events) in the data. Bivariate analysis was used on customer demographic data to understand the empirical relationship between age, gender and income for the company's customers. Bivariate analysis was also used on the event data to depict how customer activities changed as the campaign proceeding.\n\n### 3. Most popular offers & What made them popular?\nNext, I tried to answer the first business question to find better approaches to sending customers specific deals. In order to come up with better approaches, one first needs to identify the best performers in the past and figure out the key factors that contributed to the high performance. Therefore, I analized data on offers and data on offer-related events combined, in order to find the most popular offers.\n\nIn this analysis, popularity of offers is measured by its _**overall completion rate**_ - number of times an offer was completed divided by number of times it was received. Completing an offer usually requires two actions from the customers - to view it, and then complete it (by making purchases above the minimum amount required). Therefore, from an action-oriented perspective, the overall completion rate was broken down into two metrics:\n- _**View rate**_ (number of times an offer being viewed divided by number of times being received)\n- _**Completion rate**_ (number of times an offer being completed divided by number of times being viewed)\n\nI then tried to find the most important attributes of offers that affected the view rate and the completion rate, respectively. Optimizting the most important factors of the view rate and the completion rate would lead to better approaches of offer sending.\n\n### 4. Customer Segmentation\nTo answer the second business question, to recommed strategies for specific customer groups, I conducted customer segmentation based on customer behavior. KMeans Clustering was used to find customer segments that share similar behavioral patterns. \n\nVariables used for clustering were extracted from customer transactional activities, including, for each customer, number of offers viewed, number of offers completed, number of transactions made (during the month of campaign) and total amount of money spent. The number of clusters **_k_** was decided to be 5, using both the Elbow method and Silhouette score. A relative performance heatmap was used to assit the interpretation of the clustering results. Key metrics were calculated for each cluster for the final interpretation and to guide the strategies for each customer segment.\n\nCustomers were assigned into five segments that are labelled as **Most Valuable Customers**, **Regulars**, **High-potentials**, **Offer-Viewers** and **Low-engagers**. Demographic data was then taken into account to understand the customer profile of each segment.\n\n### Appendix\nThe Appendix is an extension of Section 3, where customer demographc data was included in the analysis. It investigates whether the most important contributors to offer popularity (found in Section 3) affected customer response differently for different age, gender and income groups. As a reuslt, individual demographic groups showed similar patterns to those when customers were considered as a whole (see Appendix for exceptions). Therefore, this part of analysis is only included as Appendix of the report.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2><center>Results</center></h2>\nKey findings of each section are listed below. For description and discussion in more details, please refer to the corresponding sections.   \n\n### EDA on Customer Demographics\n1. There are more males (57.2%) than females (41.3%) customers, and a small amount (1.4%) of customers of other genders.\n2. Customer age ranges from 18 to 101, roughly following a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation being 54 and 17. Customers in top 3 age groups (46-75 years old) account for 60% of all customers.\n3. Customer income (30 - 120k) is skewed to the right, having a mean of 65.4k and a standard deviation of 21.6k. Customers with a income between 45k-75k account for approximately 50% of all customers.\n4. In general, customers in younger age groups have an average income lower than those in more senior age groups. Customers in the two younger age groups (18-35 years old) has an average annual income of about 51k. The middle age groups (36-55 years old) has an average annual income of about 65k. All age groups above 56 years old have very similar average annual income of round 70k. \n5. There is a higher proportion of young people in male customer than in other genders, and (therefore) male customers have a lower average income than other gender groups.\n\n### EDA on Transactional activities\n1. In the record, there are about 140k transactions (purchases), slightly above 4 times of offers completed - many purchases were made without an offer.\n2. Approximatly 76k offers were received by customers, 76% of which were viewed and 44% were completed.\n3. An offer completion peak occurred on the same day every time offers were sent to customers.\n4. Offer completion peaks tend to lead to a short-lived (about 2 days) boost on the number of transactions. This demonstrates that proper offer sending can help form customer buying habbit (although short-lived).\n\n### Most Popular offers & What made them popular?\n1. **Overall Completion Rate:** Offers with top 3 popularity were Offer F, E and B, achieving an overall completion rate of 70%, 67.4% and 56.7%, respectively.    \n\n2. **View Rate:** the most important factor affecting the view rate is the promotion channel through which offers were received by customers. All channels contributed to offer view rate, however their importance clearly differs: **_Social Media > Email >= Mobile > Websites_**. This is the overall tendency. Perference of some individual groups may differ (details see the main body).\n\n3. **Completion Rate:** the main factor affecting the completion rate is the offer type. Specifically, **_customers preferred 'discount' offers to 'bogo' offers._** Offer duration (valid period) also positively influenced the completion rate.\n\n### Customer Segmentation\nCustomers were assigned into 5 segments, which are labelled as Most Valuable Customers, Regulars, High-Potentials, Offer-Viewers and Low-Engagers. Their behavioral characristics are summarized as key metrics shown in the chart below (for actual numbers see main body of the analysis):\n\n|Segment |Frequency |Average Purchase Value |Offer Compltetion Rate |Sensitivity to Offer \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n|**Most Valuable Customers (21.6%)** | High | High | High | Medium \n|**Regulars (10.7%)** | High | Low | Low | Medium\n|**High-Potentials (22.8%)** | Medium | High | Medium | High\n|Offer-Viewers(17.9%) | Low | Medium | Low | Medium\n|Low-Engagers (27.1%) | Low | Low | Low | Low\n\n1. The company has about 32.3% **loyal customers** with high purchase frequency. They are the Most Valuable Customers and the Regulars, who made an average of 12.2 and 17.1 purchases respectively during the month of campaign.\n\n2. The **Most Valuable Customers** had a high Average Purchase Value of 18.2 UDS. They are reasonably sensitive to offers, in that they completed most of offers they received but also made many purchases without using an offer. \n\n3. The **Regulars** had the highest purchase frequency, but a low Average Purchase Value of 4.2 USD. They are insensitive to offers, in that they made the most number of purchases but their offer completion rate is low. They have strong purchasing habbit that seems unaffected by ordinary offers.\n\n4. The company has a good percentage (22.8%) of customes with **High Potential** to become Most Valuable Customers. They did not have very high purchase frequency (7.7) but had the second highest average purchase value of 18.1 USD. Besides, they are sensitive to offers.\n\n5. Around 45% of the customers did not engage much. They are the **Offer-Viewers** and the **Low-Engagers**. They both made few purchases, 4.5 and 5 respectively. The difference between these two segments is that the Offer-Viewers, as the label suggests, have viewed most (over 90%) of the offers sent to them, while the Low-Engagers ignored a large proportion (45%) of them. The Offer-Viewers (11.1 USD) had a higher Average Purchase Value than the Low-Engagers (6.9 USD).\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2><center>Action Recommendations</center></h2>\n\n### I. Better approaches to sending offers\n\nOffers do not only bring in revenue directly, but also help improve customer stickiness. The effect of each individual offer is short-lived, therefore the company should send offers to customers at a certain frequency to help form purchasing habbit. \n\nIn order to improve the effectiveness (overall offer completion rate) of offers, the company should make efforts to improve both offer view rate and offer complete rate. Promotional channel is the most important factor influencing the offer view rate. Offer type and duration influence the offer completion rate.\n\n\n#### Improve view rate\n1. The company should make sure to send offers through social media to all customer (especially those between 18-35 years old as they viewed over 60% offers there). \n2. If budget allows, offers should be sent through Email and mobile Apps to most customer (especially those whose income between 45-105k).\n3. To save budget, website offers should only be sent to customers with incomes above 75k. (Refer to Appendix for more details.)\n\n#### Imorove completion rate (of offers viewed)\n4. Send more 'discount' offers than other types as it is preferred by customers in all age, gender and income groups \n5. Allow customers enough time (up to 10 days) to complete their offers.\n\n### II. Strategies regarding specific customer segments\n\n1. **Most Valuable Customers:** the company must make sure to keep them and maintain high customer satisfaction.  \nAt the moment, customers in this segment should be happy with what the company has been doing. Small adjustment can be tested with the goal of making them feel special. Send them a card and vouchers on their birthday, or treat they and their family and friends on special occasions like Valentine' Day, Mother's Day, Halloween, etc.\n\n\n2. **Regulars:** the company must also keep them, as well as try to increase their Average Purchase Value.  \nTry to make them buy more products together with the drink they usually buy. For example, send them offers with discout on cakes or sandwiches when they buy any drink. The customers may always choose their go-to product (a regular Americano or a large latte). The company can inspire them to buy drinks of more variety (and higher value) by sending them offers to buy seasonal drinks at discount or adding toppings or syrup into their go-to drinks for free.\n\n\n3. **High-Potentials:** they have potential to become Most valuable customers. The company should work on increasing their purchase frequency.  \nSend them more offers (as they are relatively sensitive to offers), or treat them with a free drink to let them know the company values them highly. Keep them in the loop, email them the Newsletters (after getting their consent), keep them informed about the exciting new products and special events.\n\n\n4. **Offer-Viewers:** some of them could become High-Potentials.   \nSend them offers that are hard to resisit at a high frequency. From offers with large discount to free products that look cool on social media. This should help in building their initial purchasing habbit.  \n\n\n5. **Low-Engagers:** they are either loyal to other brands or they do not have the habbit of purchasing hot beverages.  \nIt would be hard to win them with conventional promotions. They may only be attracted by unexpected events.

This reasonaly high view rate reflects a high level of customer activity and perhaps good design of promotion slogan that attracted customers to click.\n\n\n- There were roughly 33,600 offer completions, accounting for 58% of offers viewed and 44% of all offers received. This relatively high offer completion rate reflects good customer stickiness.

Note this does not mean reward negatively affected the completion rate. It was the fact that completion rate was predominantly influenced by offer type and that 'bogo' offers happened to have higher rewards (7.5 USD on average) than the 'discount' offers (3 USD on average) that led to this seemingly counter-intuitive result.\n\n- Similarly, offer difficulty seems to be possitively correlated with offer completion rate, but this does not mean difficulty positively affected the completion rate. The less popular 'bogo' offers had a lower difficulty (7.5 USD on average) than the more popular 'discount' offers (11.75 USD on average).\n\n- Duration seems to be positively correlated with offer complete rate.

The popularity of an offer is measured by the overall completion rate. The completion rate was broken down into two metrics - the view rate and the completion rate based on offers viewed.\n\nThe three questions proposed at the beginning of the section have been answered:\n1. The most popular offers were Offers F, E and B. They achieved an overall completion rate of 70%, 67.4% and 56.7%, respectively.\n2. The most important contributor to the view rate was the promotion channel. All channels led to clicks on offers, however had distinct effectiveness:\n    **Social Media > Email >= Mobile > Company Website.**\n3. The most important factor that affects the completion rate was the offer type. **Customers preferred 'discount' offers to 'bogo' offers.**\n\n**Suggestions**  \nThe company should send offers to customers through as many channels as possible. However, if the budget is tight, social media is the first choose as customers are most likely to view from there. 'Discount' is the offer type to choose as it leads to high offer completion rate.\n\n***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4.

K-Means clustering will be used to conduct the segmentation. I will use the Elbow method and the Silhouette scores to decide the number of clusters _k_.\n\nWhen analyizing and assessing the clustering results, clusters will first be visualized with 3 feature pairs in 2D planes. This will allow a quick check on whether the clustering results make intuitive sense. I will use a heatmap that reflects the relative performance of each cluster when customers were assigned to clusters to understand each cluster in a summarized manner.\n\nFor interpreting the clusters, key metrics will be calculated for each cluster. These include Average Purchase Value (APV), purchase frequency, (overall) offer complete rate and sensitivity to offers.

This means they are highly responsive to offers.\n- They did not make the most purchases (~12, about one purchase every 3 days) but spent the most money among all clusters, more than twice of the overall average during the month of campaign.  \n- They have the highest Average Purchase Value of 18.2 USD.\n- The outlier customers (money spent was among top 2%) fit in well here (will be added back).  \n\nRecommendation: The company should try their best to keep these customers, and try to attract them to make more purchases for their high average purchase value.\n\n\n**Regulars - Cluster 3**\n- These customers made the most number of purchases during the month of campaign, more than one purchase every two days - they are the company's regular customers.\n- The number of offers they viewed and completed are around overall average. They are not very sensitive to offers. They are willing to buy with or without offers.\n- Suprisingly, their total spending over the month of campaign is slightly lower than the overall average, due to a low Average Purchase Value of only 4.2 USD.\n\nCustomization: These customers are the company's regulars. They'd purchase with or without offers. They company should keep these customers and try to increase their Average Purchase Value. Maybe by letting them try high-price products for free or at a discount price to inspire them to spend more.\n\n**High-Potentials - Cluster 4**\n- These customers had the second highest Average Purchase Value of 18.1 USD (first is 18.2 USD).\n- They viewed most offers they received and completed 70% of them. \n- They have relatively high sensitivity to offers.\n\nCustomization: These customers have high potential to become Most Valuable Customers if their purchase frequency increases. As their sensitivity and response to offer is relatively high, the company should send them more offers to make them make more purchases, which will in turn enhancing their customer stickiness.\n\n**Offer-Viewers - Cluster 2**\n- These customers viewed the most offers (4.5). \n- However, they comepleted very few of them (1.5).\n- They have a moderate Average Purchase Value of 11.1 USD.  \n\nCustomization: These customers love to click offers! Send them more offers with really good deals for a variaty of products to attract them to try. This may help them form the habbit of purchasing.\n\n**Low-Engagers - Cluster 0**\n- These customers showed extemely low engagement through all features, despite the fact they received a similar number of offers to customers in other clusters. \n- They have a low Average Purchase Value of 6.9 USD.  \n\nCustomization: Currently they did not engage much, either becuase they are loyal customers of other brands or they do not have the habbit of purchasing hot beverages outside.

Therefore, increasing view rate of female customers will effectively increase the overall compeltion rate. Male customers are the least responsive to offers, having the lowest rates.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How `age` influenced cutomer response to offers?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Group data\ngrouped_by_age = event_offer_customer.groupby(['age_group', 'event']).agg({'hours_since_start': 'count'})\nage_group_list = ['18-25ys', '26-35ys', '36-45ys', '46-55ys', '56-65ys', '66-75ys', '76-85ys', '> 86ys']\n\n# Calculate view rate\nview_rate = []\nfor i in range(len(age_group_list)):\n    view_rate.append(grouped_by_age.loc[(age_group_list[i], 'offer viewed')] / grouped_by_age.loc[(age_group_list[i], 'offer received')])\nview_rate = [x[0] for x in view_rate]\n\n# Calculate complete rate\ncomplete_rate = []\nfor i in range(len(age_group_list)):\n    complete_rate.append(grouped_by_age.loc[(age_group_list[i], 'offer completed')] / grouped_by_age.loc[(age_group_list[i], 'offer viewed')])\ncomplete_rate = [x[0] for x in complete_rate]\n\n# Calculate overall complete rate\noverall_complete_rate = []\nfor i in range(len(age_group_list)):\n    overall_complete_rate.append(grouped_by_age.loc[(age_group_list[i], 'offer completed')] / grouped_by_age.loc[(age_group_list[i], 'offer received')])\noverall_complete_rate = [x[0] for x in overall_complete_rate]\n\n# Visualize\nxticks = np.arange(len(age_group_list))\nyticks = np.arange(0,1.2, 0.2)\nytick_labels = [str(n) + '%' for n in (yticks * 100).astype(int)]\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize = (18, 6))\nsns.barplot(x = np.arange(len(age_group_list)), y = view_rate, ax = axs[0])\nsns.barplot(x = np.arange(len(age_group_list)), y = complete_rate, ax = axs[1])\nsns.barplot(x = np.arange(len(age_group_list)), y = overall_complete_rate, ax = axs[2])\naxs[0].set_title('View Rate %'); axs[0].set_xlabel('Age Group'); axs[0].set_ylabel('Group Average')\naxs[0].set_xticklabels(age_group_list, rotation=45); axs[0].set_yticks(yticks); axs[0].set_yticklabels(ytick_labels)\naxs[1].set_title('Complete Rate %'); axs[1].set_xlabel('Age Group'); axs[1].set_ylabel('Group Average')\naxs[1].set_xticklabels(age_group_list, rotation=45); axs[1].set_yticks(yticks); axs[1].set_yticklabels(ytick_labels)\naxs[2].set_title('Overall Complete Rate %'); axs[2].set_xlabel('Age Group'); axs[2].set_ylabel('Group Average')\naxs[2].set_xticklabels(age_group_list, rotation=45); axs[2].set_yticks(yticks); axs[2].set_yticklabels(ytick_labels)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-20T16:16:14.822788Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-20T16:16:14.82328Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-20T16:16:15.402001Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-20T16:16:14.823237Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-20T16:16:15.401088Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Observations**\n- Trends accross different age groups are weak.

answered:\n\n1. How customer attributes affected their response to offers?\n- Income is found to be the most important factor that influence the overall completion rate among all attributes (age, gender and income). The overall completion rate increased steadlily with income between 30-90k, from 35% to 61%, and keeps unchanged afterwards.\n\n- There are some overlapping behavioral trends between young custmers and those with relatively low income. This is to some extend becuase on average younger customers have lower incomes, as found in the bivariate analysis on cutomer profile data.\n\n- In general, female senior customers with high income are the most responsive to offers, having the highest overall completion rate.\n\n2. How offer attributes affected customer response for customers in different age, gender and income groups?\n\n- Regarding promotion channels, customers in all age, gender and income groups preferred social media to other channels (the only exception is customers of other genders viewed most offers through email). Ingeneral email comes second and mobile third. However, customers with the highest income (> 105k) viewed more offers from the company's website than email and mobile. (_See above for detailed comparison_)\n\n- 'Discount' is the preferred offer type of customers in all age, gender and income groups. Young customers on the lower half of income spectrum (30-75k) are the most senstive to offer type.\n\n***","metadata":{}}]}
